## Note
Be sure to run a virtual environment to install dependencies. The virtual environment is ignored by Git for integrity reasons so you will need to install dependencies when you first clone this repository.

(On windows, feel free to check Derek's old notes for the exact commands on Linux and Mac, although I don't think it's too different)
1. Go to terminal and type "py -m venv venv"
2. Once the venv folder has been generated, type "./venv/Scripts/activate.bat"
3. In the terminal, install the packages with "pip install -r requirements.txt"
4. Make sure to add "venv/" to the .gitignore file if it is not present
5. In the terminal, type "./venv/Scripts/deactivate.bat
