# Because we have a shared directory with shared libraries up 2 dirs from this location.

# cd into the root location of the project and ...
export PYTHONPATH=$(pwd)/backend/events
echo $PYTHONPATH 
uvicorn backend.events.main:app --reload


# You should not be able to do rapid developement using swagger url to test as you go along....


# NOW YOU may focus on getting the container build - NOTE this is not docker compose yet.....

Same issue here -getting your app access to the common folder...... BUT its a different solution 
this time - we have to mount the machine directory into the container....

we do this via 2 steps - building and running 
Building we do IN the microservice directory
running from teh root dir


cd backend/event
docker build -t event_service .
cd ../..

# Then run with mount
docker run -p 8001:8000 -v $(pwd)/common:/app/common events_service
```

## **Access the Service**
```
http://localhost:8001/events/docs
